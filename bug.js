This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version incompatibility.  The error message might mention a mismatch between the AGP version required by Expo and the version installed in the Android Studio project.  This incompatibility can arise due to outdated Android Studio components or conflicting dependencies.
